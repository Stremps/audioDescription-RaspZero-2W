# Audio Description Project for Visually Impaired

## Overview
This project aims to validate the use of targeted audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals, now utilizing only a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W equipped with a Raspberry Pi Camera. The goal is to explore how effective this simplified setup can be in providing audio descriptions based on visual data captured by the camera, without the need for complex hardware.

## Functionality

### `AudioDescription`
This script is designed to capture images using the Raspberry Pi Camera and generate audio descriptions of the captured scene. The audio output provides an overall context of the environment, enhancing spatial awareness for visually impaired users.

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore how audio descriptions generated through AI can aid visually impaired individuals, even with minimal hardware like a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. By focusing on a more accessible and affordable setup, the project seeks to demonstrate how technology can be leveraged to create more inclusive experiences for visually impaired individuals.

## Usage
To use the script, ensure the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and Raspberry Pi Camera are properly set up and connected. The script captures images and processes them to generate real-time audio descriptions, providing immediate feedback to the user.
